Phase 1: Take-off and Target Acquisition
    • UAV-1 and UAV-2 take off under GCS control.
    • UAV-2 identifies the target attachment point using onboard vision and position data.
    • UAV-1 positions near the target zone and awaits spraying command.
Phase 2: Adhesive Spraying (UAV-1)
    • UAV-1 approaches the surface, cleans, and sprays the adhesive component at the marked location.
    • Coordinates are relayed to UAV-2 for alignment.
Phase 3: Sensor Deployment (UAV-2)
    • UAV-2 navigates to the marked location.
    • The trajectory algorithm ensures that the manipulator end-effector remains parallel to the wall.
    • UAV-2 approaches the surface and begins the contact procedure.
    • Adaptive impedance control is engaged to maintain steady pressure during bonding.
